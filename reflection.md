# PawPal+ Project Reflection

## 1. System Design

**a. Initial design**

- Briefly describe your initial UML design.
- What classes did you include, and what responsibilities did you assign to each?
Ans: My initial UML design for PawPal+ included four main classes: `Owner`, `Pet`, `Task`, and `PawPalSystem`. The `Owner` class represents the user and stores the pets they care for. The `Pet` class stores details about each pet, such as name, species, breed, age, weight, and its list of care tasks. The `Task` class represents a pet care activity, such as feeding, walking, grooming, or a vet visit. The `PawPalSystem` class acts as the main coordinator for the app by managing owners, finding pets, sending reminders, and generating a daily schedule.

The main relationships in my design are that one `Owner` can have many `Pet` objects, and one `Pet` can have many `Task` objects. The three core user actions are adding pets, creating pet care tasks, and generating or viewing a daily schedule of tasks.

**b. Design changes**

- Did your design change during implementation?
- If yes, describe at least one change and why you made it.
Ans: Yes, my design changed after reviewing the first skeleton. The original design only had one-way relationships from `PawPalSystem` to `Owner`, from `Owner` to `Pet`, and from `Pet` to `Task`. I updated the design to include back-references so that a `Task` can reference its `Pet`, and a `Pet` can reference its `Owner`. This makes features like `send_reminder(task)` easier because the system can quickly find the correct owner through `task.pet.owner` instead of scanning through every owner, pet, and task.

I also updated the `Task` class to include `priority` and `duration_minutes` because the app needs those fields to generate a useful schedule. Without them, `generate_schedule()` would not know which tasks are most important or how long each task takes. Finally, I changed `generate_schedule()` to accept an `owner`, a `day`, and `available_minutes` so it can create a daily plan within a time budget.

## 2. Scheduling Logic and Tradeoffs

**a. Constraints and priorities**

- What constraints does your scheduler consider (for example: time, priority, preferences)?
- How did you decide which constraints mattered most?

**b. Tradeoffs**

- Describe one tradeoff your scheduler makes.
- Why is that tradeoff reasonable for this scenario?

---

## 3. AI Collaboration

**a. How you used AI**

- How did you use AI tools during this project (for example: design brainstorming, debugging, refactoring)?
- What kinds of prompts or questions were most helpful?

**b. Judgment and verification**

- Describe one moment where you did not accept an AI suggestion as-is.
- How did you evaluate or verify what the AI suggested?

---

## 4. Testing and Verification

**a. What you tested**

- What behaviors did you test?
- Why were these tests important?

**b. Confidence**

- How confident are you that your scheduler works correctly?
- What edge cases would you test next if you had more time?

## 5. Reflection

**a. What went well**

- What part of this project are you most satisfied with?

**b. What you would improve**

- If you had another iteration, what would you improve or redesign?

**c. Key takeaway**

- What is one important thing you learned about designing systems or working with AI on this project?
